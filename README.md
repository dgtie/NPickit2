Not a Pickit 2 - porting pickit 2 code to PIC32MX250F128D

I made a PIC32 programmer using a PIC32MX250F128D with minimal hardware. In fact, the only additional component need is a resistor on the PGC line. The code is adapted from Pickit 2 and aims to work with PIC32PROG. In order to let PIC32PROG to recognised it, it claims itself a pickit 2 in the USB system.

The crystal in use is 8 MHz.
